	<p>I've created a very simple github project for you to try and decipher for yourself!!!!!!</p>

	<p>If you can see this message, you are one step closer to the CROWN JEWELS</p>

	<p>Make some changes to the files, add what you want etc... Extra files... JavaScript... Images... Then commit them to the repository.</p>

	<p>Git will log all the changes we make, and keep prior versions of them.</p>
